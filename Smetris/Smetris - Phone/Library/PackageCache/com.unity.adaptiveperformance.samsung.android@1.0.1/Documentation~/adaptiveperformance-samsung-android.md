# About the Adaptive Performance Samsung (Android) package

The Adaptive Performance Samsung (Android) Provider is a subsystem for the [Adaptive Performance](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.adaptiveperformance@latest/index.html) package, to extend Adaptive Performance to Samsung Android devices. It transmits device-specific information to the Adaptive Performance package, and enables you to receive data about the thermal state of a Samsung Android device.

# Installing the Adaptive Performance Samsung (Android) package

To install this package, follow the instructions in the [Package Manager documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-manager-ui@latest/index.html). 

Unity automatically installs the Adaptive Performance package as a dependency of the Samsung (Android) subsystem. You can use Adaptive Performance as soon as installation through the Package Manager completes.

This subsystem is only a data provider for Adaptive Performance, and has no user-facing APIs. The Adaptive Performance package includes all functionality. For details, see the [Adaptive Performance](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.adaptiveperformance@latest/index.html) documentation.
